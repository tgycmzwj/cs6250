# CS 6250 Spring 2021 - SDN Firewall Project with POX
# build leucosia-v20
#
# This file contains the rules for the firewall as specified in the Project Documentation.  
#
# Rule Format:
# RuleNumber,Action,Source MAC,Destination MAC,Source IP,Destination IP,Protocol,Source Port,Destination Port,Comment/Note
# RuleNumber = this is a rule number to help you track a particular rule - it is not used in the firewall implementation
# Action = Block or Allow , Allow Rules need to take precedence over Block Rules
# Source / Destination MAC address in form of xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
# Source / Destination IP Address in form of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx in CIDR notation
# Protocol = integer IP protocol number per IANA (0-254)
# Source / Destination Port = if Protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the Application Port Number per IANA
# Comment/Note = this is for your use in tracking rules.
#
# Any field not being used for a match should have a '-' character as it's entry (except for RuleNumber/Comment)
# Do not pad any of the entries (i.e., have a rule like:  1, Block, -, -,...)
#
# Warning:  For the IP address, you need to specify an appropriate network address
# that matches the subnet mask you are using.  For instance, if you want to use a /16
# subnet mask, then the IP address must be x.x.0.0.  For example, a proper address to 
# reference a 192.168.10.x/24 network would be 192.168.10.0/24.  A single host
# is addressed as a single IP address with a /32.
#
# Example Rules:
#1,Block,-,-,10.0.0.1/32,10.0.1.0/24,6,-,80,Block host 10.0.0.1 from accessing a web server on the 10.0.1.0/24 network
#2,Allow,-,-,10.0.0.1/32,10.0.1.125/32,6,-,80,Allow 10.0.0.1 to access a web server on 10.0.1.125 overriding previous rule


# block connection from US to UK
# this rule is intentionally placed at the end

# allow restricted connection from ATL to LDN
2,Allow,-,-,10.0.1.1/32,10.0.2.1/32,17,-,10,allow ATL to LDN with UDP at port 10
2,Allow,-,-,10.0.1.1/32,10.0.2.1/32,6,-,30,allow ATL to LDN with TCP from port 60 at ATL
2,Allow,-,-,10.0.1.1/32,10.0.2.1/32,6,20,40,allow ATL to LDN with TCP from port 20 to port 40

# allow connection from DAL to MCR through TCP dst port 4, 5, 6 and 7
# use DAL MAC and MCR IP
3,Allow,00:00:00:00:01:1e,-,-,10.0.2.2/32,6,-,4,allow connection from DAL to MCR
# use DAL IP and MCR IP
3,Allow,-,-,10.0.1.2/32,10.0.2.2/32,6,-,5,allow connection from DAL to MCR
# use DAL IP and MCR MAC
3,Allow,-,00:00:00:02:01:1e,10.0.1.2/32,-,6,-,6,allow connection from DAL to MCR
# use DAL MAC and MCR MAC
3,Allow,00:00:00:00:01:1e,00:00:00:02:01:1e,-,-,6,-,7,allow connection from DAL to MCR

# block connection from US to UK
1,Block,-,-,10.0.1.0/24,10.0.2.0/24,-,-,-,block subnets
