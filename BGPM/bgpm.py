# Task 1A: Unique Advertised Prefixes Over Time
def unique_prefixes_by_snapshot(cache_files):
    """
    Retrieve the number of unique IP prefixes from each of the input BGP data files.

    Args:
        cache_files: A chronologically sorted list of absolute (also called "fully qualified") path names

    Returns:
        A list containing the number of unique IP prefixes for each input file.
        For example: [2, 5]

    """
    Retrieve the number of unique ASes from each of the input BGP data files.

    Args:
        cache_files: A chronologically sorted list of absolute (also called "fully qualified") path names

    Returns:
        A list containing the number of unique ASes for each input file.

# Task 1C: Top-10 Origin AS by Prefix Growth
def top_10_ases_by_prefix_growth(cache_files):
    """
    Compute the top 10 origin ASes ordered by percentage increase (smallest to largest) of advertised prefixes.

    Args:
        cache_files: A chronologically sorted list of absolute (also called "fully qualified") path names

    Returns:
        A list of the top 10 origin ASes ordered by percentage increase (smallest to largest) of advertised prefixes
        AS numbers are represented as strings.

        For example: ["777", "1", "6"]
          corresponds to AS "777" as having the smallest percentage increase (of the top ten) and AS "6" having the
          highest percentage increase (of the top ten).

# Task 2: Routing Table Growth: AS-Path Length Evolution Over Time
def shortest_path_by_origin_by_snapshot(cache_files):
    """
    Compute the shortest AS path length for every origin AS from input BGP data files.

    Retrieves the shortest AS path length for every origin AS for every input file.
    Your code should return a dictionary where every key is a string representing an AS name and every value is a list
    of the shortest path lengths for that AS.

    Note: If a given AS is not present in an input file, the corresponding entry for that AS and file should be zero (0)
    Every list value in the dictionary should have the same length.

    Args:
        cache_files: A chronologically sorted list of absolute (also called "fully qualified") path names

    Returns:
        A dictionary where every key is a string representing an AS name and every value is a list, containing one entry
        per file, of the shortest path lengths for that AS
        AS numbers are represented as strings.

        For example: {"455": [4, 2, 3], "533": [4, 1, 2]}
        corresponds to the AS "455" with the shortest path lengths 4, 2 and 3 and the AS "533" with the shortest path
        lengths 4, 1 and 2.

    Identify Announcement and Withdrawal events and compute the duration of all explicit AW events in the input BGP data

    Args:
        cache_files: A chronologically sorted list of absolute (also called "fully qualified") path names

    Returns:
        A dictionary where each key is a string representing the IPv4 address of a peer (peerIP) and each value is a
        dictionary with keys that are strings representing a prefix and values that are the list of explicit AW event
        durations (in seconds) for that peerIP and prefix pair.

        For example: {"127.0.0.1": {"12.13.14.0/24": [4.0, 1.0, 3.0]}}

        cache_files: A chronologically sorted list of absolute (also called "fully qualified") path names
